All I'm doing here is trying something new. I don't particularly enjoy writing, although I do keep a journal. In this post I would like to start sharing my experiences with self-improvement - and where I think it should stop. 

I've been committing a few hours of the day towards improving myself - whether that be learning a new skill or improving existing ones for 6 days a week for the past 2 years now. To name a few of the things that have kept me busy (and feeling fulfilled):

* Started a kickboxing class (again) and got to green belt grade.
* Learned the Punjabi language to somewhat fluency.
* Quit my job as an engineer to pursue a different career in tech.
* Made and stuck to diet and workout routines leading to a muscular physique. Much better than when I started.
* Developed the habit of reading - self-help books in particular. 



Doing all of this has not been easy. But in the difficulty I have learned to overcome 'everyday' obstacles. And ultimately, I would definitely say it has made me happier. I hesitate to use the word happy, as happiness comes and goes all the time - most times we can't help it. A better word would be **excited,** (thanks Tim - <https://medium.com/@Malcolm_Ocean/pretty-sure-this-was-tim-ferriss-excitement-is-the-more-practical-synonym-for-happiness-and-it-81a44b6d5a57>).[](https://medium.com/@Malcolm_Ocean/pretty-sure-this-was-tim-ferriss-excitement-is-the-more-practical-synonym-for-happiness-and-it-81a44b6d5a57)



My life has more meaning now. When I fell like I am working toward something I get excited, and I want to get up in the mornings. When I'm not - and say stuck in a rut or having a shitty day at work, I know that in the near future, I will be back to my usual self. Ready to go again. But is this any way to live for you? I can't say for sure, but it excites me and it's become what I live for. My career, my health, my wealth. All of this going well leads to me enjoying my down-time more, like recently I went snowboarding.



To conclude, I believe finding meaningful work has had the biggest impact on my life so far - but it goes further than that. When the work day is over, what are you doing? If it's something to don't really enjoy, I would encourage you to seek out something that excites you. This way of thinking has transformed my perspective on life, and the way I live it.



In the next few posts I'll dive more into my career, and how I am still finding a work-life balance.
