### Why this website?
This website serves the purpose of providing me with experience of creating and managing a blog, giving any would-be readers of the posts information of some value, however random they may be.

### Theme / Category
I don't have a particular theme in mind right now, just my life experinces in general and any useful bits of information that I feel should be shared.

### What to expect
I currently work as a front end developer, so there will definitely be some dev related content. I don't want to lock myself down to that though, as I have many other interests. After the coronavirus pandemic lockdown measures ease (soon maybe?) then I will be posting travel content, advice etc.

Financial freedom and investing will be a large part of this too, advice being for everyone but especially for young people, who like me, are more tempted to put their money elsewhere. I realise the importance of creating wealth early on in life and hopefully I can convince other young people to follow my lead and create something extraordinary for theirselves and their familes.
